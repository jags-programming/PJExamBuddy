üìê High-Level Architecture

[User Browser]
     |
     v
[Next.js Frontend]
 - Renders questions & formulas
 - Renders charts, options, results
 - Calls FastAPI backend via REST
     |
     v
[FastAPI Backend]
 - Handles authentication
 - Fetches question data
 - Calculates results
 - Serves assets/images
     |
     v
[PostgreSQL DB]
 - Stores users, questions, answers, scores, explanations
üß™ Example Use Case: A Multiple-Choice Math Question
Question is stored in PostgreSQL with LaTeX formula:

latex
What is the value of $\int_0^\pi \sin x \, dx$?
Frontend renders the question using KaTeX:

import 'katex/dist/katex.min.css';
import { BlockMath } from 'react-katex';

<BlockMath math={question.text} />
User selects answer, which is submitted to FastAPI.

Backend compares submitted answer with correct answer, stores result, and returns explanation (also LaTeX or HTML).

üöÄ Suggested Dev Roadmap (MVP)
Auth System

Register/Login (JWT based)

Question Bank Management

Admin panel (or DB UI) to add/edit questions

Test Builder

Select questions by topic/difficulty/type

Test-Taking UI

Timer, question navigation, submission

Result & Review

Show answers, explanations, scores

üí° Optional Enhancements
Feature	Tooling
Offline mode	PWA with local IndexedDB
Export to PDF	WeasyPrint / Puppeteer
Real-time quizzes	WebSocket with FastAPI
Admin dashboard	React-Admin / custom UI
AI-powered hints	Use OpenAI API optionally

Keeping data in a flat excel fille:
===================================

‚úÖ Benefits of Using Excel Initially
Easy to Populate: Non-developers (e.g., subject matter experts) can contribute questions without needing database or UI knowledge.

Bulk Entry: Easier to prepare large sets of questions across topics and exams.

Version Control: You can keep track of question versions or review cycles through separate sheets or columns.

CSV Import Ready: Easily import into your database once your backend is ready.

üìÑ Recommended Flat Structure (Excel Columns)
Here‚Äôs a suggested structure for your Excel file (each row = one question):

QuestionID	Exam	Subject	Topic	SubTopic	Type	Difficulty	QuestionText	OptionA	OptionB	OptionC	OptionD	CorrectOptions	Explanation	Hint	Tags
101	JEE	Physics	Mechanics	Kinematics	MCQ-Single	Medium	What is the displacement...	2 m	3 m	4 m	5 m	B	Use v = u + at ...	Think about ...	velocity, motion
102	SAT	Math	Algebra	Linear Eq	MCQ-Multiple	Easy	Which of the following...	x=2	x=3	x=4	x=5	A,C	Substitute and verify...	Try x=2 first	roots
103	Olymp	Chem	Atomic Struct	-	True/False	Hard	Isotope have same protons...	True	False			A	They differ in neutrons	Focus on protons	atom, isotope

You can store LaTeX in QuestionText, Option*, Explanation if needed. If Excel doesn't handle rendering well, it‚Äôs fine‚Äîyour app will.

üîÑ Transition to Database
When you‚Äôre ready:

Export Excel to CSV

Use Python script (with pandas) or backend logic to ingest into PostgreSQL


import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_excel('question_bank.xlsx')
# validate & push to DB using SQLAlchemy or SQLModel
üìå Best Practices
Use unique Question IDs even in Excel

Keep consistent naming for categories

Use enumerated types for fields like Type (MCQ-Single, MCQ-Multiple, TrueFalse, AssertionReason)

Sanitize LaTeX strings to avoid formatting issues later
